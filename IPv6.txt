IPv6 is 128 bits long, 
means 16 bytes 128 / 8 (8 bits = 1 bytes) = 16 bytes.

This 128 bits consist of 8 groups.
each group consist of 4 hexadecimal.
4 hexadecimal consist of 16 bits. 
(1 hexadecimal need 4 bits, as hexadecimal code up to go 0-15, so we need 16 representational
numbers, so, 2 ^ 4 = 16 bits).

16 bits * 8 (groups) = 128 bits.
